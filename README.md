# 42Hive_GetNextLine

"Write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor."

Allowed libc functions: read, malloc and free.
Functions made in Libft can be used.

The function itself can be tested just by cloning the repo and writing "make".  
It will then print lines from two separate files to demonstrate it can hanlde multiple file descriptors.
